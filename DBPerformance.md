## Database performance review inserting Synthentic demographi dataset into MongoDB vs PostgreSQL

Looking at the Python data generation logs, We can see a demographic data generator that creates synthetic population data and stores it in both MongoDB and PostgreSQL. Below is a comprehensive performance analysis dashboard comparing MongoDB and PostgreSQL for the demographic data generation system. 

**Key findings:**

- Performance Summary
- MongoDB outperformed PostgreSQL by 11.2% in terms of throughput:

**MongoDB**:    1,264.65 records/second (15.67s runtime)
**PostgreSQL**: 1,137.28 records/second (17.57s runtime)

**Key Observations:**

- Speed Advantage:    MongoDB was 1.9 seconds faster, processing nearly 20,000 records
- Data Volume:        PostgreSQL actually generated slightly more records (19,982 vs 19,817)
- Connection Time:    Both databases had identical connection establishment times (0.03s)
- Consistency:        Both maintained good data integrity throughout the generation process


**Technical Analysis:**

From our Python code, we can see we're using:

- Batch based processing: of 200 records per batch

  - Complex data structures: Nested family/children relationships
  - Multiple collections/tables: Adults, children, and families
  - JSON storage: PostgreSQL using JSON columns vs MongoDB's native document structure


**Recommendations:**

- For write-heavy workloads: MongoDB's document model shows clear advantages
- For analytical queries: PostgreSQL's relational structure and SQL capabilities would likely perform better
- Architecture consideration: The nested family data structure aligns naturally with MongoDB's document model
