# Demographic Data Generator

..

### About the App Design

Originally written as pure procedural, until I got it all working, then spend some time rewriting some bits with some assistance from [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) & [Gemini](http://gemini.google.com) into Object Orientated Python Classes, well where it made sense for me, and not. 

It's not all copy paste, neither of these AI are to clever at time, it takes repeated attempts with perfecting various prompts to get the scafoldig you want and then still a fair amount of code modify... And none of this wil even work out/make sense if you don't have a good idea whats needed and how it should all fit together... 


### Python Faker

Heavily used in addition to some custom providers. You will find all the custom providers as `faker_*.py`.


### Seed data

There are 2 primary see data files that is used by the generator, see `../data/*.json`, these are used in addition to the option_list.py which drives some generic dat sets and their not so random selection.
